courses.christopherbaker.net
============================

A code repository to support teaching activities @ http://courses.christopherbaker.net

How To:
============================

1. Follow the instructions to install _Git_ on [this site]( https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git).  If you want to go the easy GUI route, follow the instructions to use the GUI version.  Get the Mac version [here](https://central.github.com/mac/latest) or the Windows version [here](http://github-windows.s3.amazonaws.com/GitHubSetup.exe).  If you are running Linux, then you probably didn't want a GUI anyway, so follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-linux).

2. Next, go [here](https://github.com/bakercp/courses.christopherbaker.net) and find the button on the upper left that says looks like this:

3. Press the button and it should launch the Git App and clone the repository.  You'll find a newly cloned repository including all of the files from the _courses.christopherbaker.net_ project.  You can stay up to date with the latest changes and additions by synchronizing the repo using the Git GUI.  If you like, you can also receive updates whenever there are changes by subscribing to the repository.

4.  Finally, if you want to know more about Git and how it works, you can take a crash course [here](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Git-Basics).
